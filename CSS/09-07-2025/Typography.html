              -US President Donald Trump has hit out at former close ally Elon
              Musk over the multi-billionaire's plan to launch a new political
              party.
              <br />
              -"I think it's ridiculous to start a third party," said Trump,
              speaking to reporters on Sunday before boarding Air Force One.<wbr />
              "It's always been a two-party system and I think starting a third
              party just adds to the confusion."
              <br />
              -After teasing the idea for weeks, Musk posted on X over the
              weekend that he had set up the America Party to challenge the
              Republican and Democratic "Uniparty".
              <br />
              -Trump and Musk were formerly close allies, with the Tesla boss
              leading the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge),<wbr />
              which is tasked with helping to cut federal spending.

            <p>
              Elon Musk says he is launching a new political party, weeks after
              dramatically falling out with US President Donald Trump.
              <br />
              The billionaire announced on his social media platform X that he
              had set up the America Party, billing it as a challenge to the
              Republican and Democratic two-party system.
              <br />
              However, it is unclear if the party has been formally registered
              with US election authorities. Musk, who was born outside of the US
              and is thus ineligible to run for the US presidency, does not say
              who will lead it.
              <br />
              He first raised the prospect of forming a party during his public
              feud with Trump, which saw him leave his role in the
              administration and engage in a vicious public spat with his former
              ally.
              <br />
              During that row, Musk posted a poll on X asking users if there
              should be a new political party in the US.
              <br />
              Referencing that poll in his post on Saturday, Musk wrote: "By a
              factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall
              have it!

              <mark>Australia see off West Indies to wrap up series win</mark>
            </h3>
            <ins
              cite="https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c0k7plvl614o"
              datetime="2025-07-06 09:10:45"

            <p>
              After setting the home side 277 to win on a difficult pitch, the
              tourists ripped through the West Indies batters in 34.3 overs to
              take an unassailable 2-0 series lead.
              <br />
              Having wrapped up the first Test inside three days in Barbados
              with a 159-run victory, Australia enjoyed a similar winning margin
              on day four in Grenada, by 133 runs.
              <br />
              They can complete a series clean sweep when the two sides meet in
              Jamaica next week.
              <br />
              Day four started with Shamar Joseph (4-66) and namesake Alzarri
              Joseph (2-52) cleaning up the Australia tail inside 45 minutes.
              <br />
              But on a pitch offering the bowlers plenty, chasing 277 for
              victory was always going to be a daunting task for West Indies.
              <br />
              And so it proved once John Campbell fell leg before for a duck in
              the second over off the bowling of Josh Hazlewood (2-33).
              <br />
              Mitchell Starc had Keacy Carty caught for 10 for the first of his
              three wickets, while opener Kraigg Brathwaite was also caught off
              the bowling of Beau Webster for seven to leave West Indies 29-3.
              <br />
              The home side were then four down at lunch as Pat Cummins
              dismissed Brandon King for 14.
              <br />
              Shai Hope (34) and captain Roston Chase (17) provided some
              resistance in the afternoon session before both fell to Hazlewood
              and Starc respectively.
              <br />
              Starc then dismissed Justin Greaves for two before brief fireworks
              from Shamar Joseph (24) and Alzarri Joseph (13) - hitting five
              sixes between them - were brought to an end by Nathan Lyon's spin.

              <mark>English amateur Woad, 21, wins Women's Irish Open</mark>
            </h3>
            <ins

            </ins>
            <p>
              English amateur Lottie Woad carded a four-under final-round 69 to
              claim her first Ladies European Tour title in dominant fashion
              with a six-shot victory at the Women's Irish Open.
              <br />
              But because Woad is an amateur, she will not receive any prize
              money, with the 67,500 euro (Â£58,000) winner's cheque going to
              Sweden's four-time Solheim Cup player Madelene Sagstrom, who
              finished second.
              <br />
              Woad, the world number one amateur, hit the front in windy
              conditions on Friday, extended her lead to seven strokes in
              Saturday's third round and made six birdies and two bogeys on
              Sunday to cruise home at Carton House.
              <br />
              The 21-year-old - who broke 70 in all four rounds - becomes the
              first non-professional to win on the Ladies European Tour since
              Czech player Jana Melichova at the 2022 Czech Ladies Open.
              <br />
              Woad, who won the 2024 Augusta National Women's Amateur title and
              finished tied 10th in last year's Women's Open, carded just three
              bogeys all week in a hugely impressive performance in County
              Kildare.
              <br />
              "It felt pretty comfortable overall," said Woad.
              <br />
              "There were a few moments at the start of the back nine that
              could've gone wrong but I hung in there and finished with some
              nice birdies.
              <br />
              "As soon as I birdied the second hole, holed a nice 12-footer
              there, it settled me in. I hit some good shots today, maybe didn't
              hole as many putts as the other days, but it was pretty stress
              free in the end."
              <br />
              Sagstrom, with a final round of 68, finished second with England's
              world number 19 Charley Hull (69) in fourth.

              The European Union has firmly rejected mounting calls from major
              tech companies, including Alphabet, Meta to delay the
              implementation of its Artificial Intelligence Act. Many big tech
              companies and even the several European AI firms such as ASML and
              Mistral asked the commission to hold on the implementation, citing
              high compliance costs and complex regulatory requirements.
              However, the EU has now made it clear that the legal timeline for
              rolling out the AI Act will remain unchanged.
